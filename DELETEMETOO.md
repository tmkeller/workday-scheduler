## Objectives

Modify the starter code provided by bootcamp staff to build an interactive, dynamic password generator. This app has the following attributes:

* Randomly generates a password that can be easily copy-pasted from the textarea window.
* Allows the user to customize number of characters (must be between 8 and 128), and whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
* Responsive layout.
* Throws error alerts when the user fails to specify a number of characters within range or fails to specify at least one of the 4 types of characters to include.
* Uses HTML checkboxes and input elements instead of prompt and confirm popups to allow for a more streamlined user interface.
* Dark theme for ease of viewing.
